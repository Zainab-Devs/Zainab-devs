## Hey, I'm Zainab 👋

👩‍🎓 I'm a Software Engineer Grad(3.7/4.0), with a strong passion for Web Dev with Daily Learning.

## 🧰ToolBox

- **Languages/Libraries**: `React` `Redux-Toolkit` `RTK Query` `Antd` `JSX` `JS` `HTML` `CSS`
- **Version Control**: `Git` `Gitbash`
- **Code Editor**: `VS-Code` `Replit`
- **Deployment**: `Netlify`

## 👾Full-Stack Aspirations Fueled by JavaScript and LeetCode
From concept to creation! Over 20+ LeetCode problems conquered are just the warm-up. I built a Replit playground to showcase my JavaScript journey, and now, I'm diving headfirst into the domain of Next.js to expand my full-stack horizons!
